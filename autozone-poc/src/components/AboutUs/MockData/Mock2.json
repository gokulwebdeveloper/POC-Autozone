                "para1": "AutoZone's history started with the vision of one man: J.R. \"Pitt\" Hyde III. After receiving his bachelor's degree in Economics, Pitt joined Malone & Hyde, Inc., a wholesale food company founded by his grandfather. He launched and developed Malone & Hyde's specialty retailing division, beginning with drug stores and expanding into sporting goods stores and supermarkets. During his research into new, potential markets, Pitt recognized the need for a retail automotive parts store that could help ordinary people take care of their vehicles by providing quality parts and Trustworthy Advice. Pitt believed that the characteristics found in supermarkets - clean, well-organized stores, accessible products, and great customer service - could be applied to the automotive parts business. In 1979, his vision became a reality."
